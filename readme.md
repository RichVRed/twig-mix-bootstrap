# Twig, Laravel Mix, Bootstrap 4 alpha

Felt like experimenting a bit, so decided to combine a bunch of shiny things I like.

This includes:
- [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix)
- [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)
- [PHRoute](https://github.com/mrjgreen/phroute)

## Setup

- Run `npm install`, or `yarn` to install dependencies from `package.json`
- Run `composer install` for PHP dependencies
- Check out the scripts in `package.json` for different commands, or check out the above links for more info
